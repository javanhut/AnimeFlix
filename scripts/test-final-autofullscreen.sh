echo "🎬 FINAL Auto-Fullscreen Test - Fresh Build Complete!"
echo "====================================================="

echo ""
echo "🆕 What's New (Fresh Build):"
echo "• Complete rebuild from scratch - no cache"
echo "• All auto-fullscreen transition fixes applied"
echo "• Permission dialog system"
echo "• Fullscreen maintenance during auto-next"
echo "• Smart detection of manual vs automatic exits"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Step-by-Step Test:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🌐 Open: http://localhost:3050"
echo "2. ⚙️  Go to Settings (gear icon) → General tab"
echo "3. ☑️  Check 'Auto-Fullscreen' checkbox"
echo "4. 🎥 Navigate to Go! Go! Loser Ranger → Episode 1"
echo "5. ▶️  Click Play button"
echo "6. 📋 Permission dialog appears → Click 'Allow'"
echo "7. 🎬 Video goes fullscreen immediately"
echo "8. ⏳ Let episode finish completely (or skip to end)"
echo "9. 🔄 Auto-next Episode 2 should START IN FULLSCREEN!"
echo "10. ✅ Success: Fullscreen maintained through transition!"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected Results:"
echo ""
echo "✅ Episode 1: Permission dialog → Allow → Fullscreen"
echo "✅ Episode 2: STARTS and STAYS in fullscreen"
echo "✅ Episode 3: STARTS and STAYS in fullscreen"
echo "✅ Manual exit: Press Escape → Exits fullscreen but remembers choice"
echo "✅ New manual play: Resets and works again"

echo ""
echo "🐛 If Auto-Next STILL Exits Fullscreen:"
echo ""
echo "• Open browser console (F12)"
echo "• Look for these logs during auto-next:"
echo "  - '🔄 Attempting to restore fullscreen for auto-next episode'"
echo "  - '✅ Fullscreen restored for auto-next episode'"
echo "  - '⚡ Immediately restoring fullscreen after transition'"
echo ""
echo "• Missing logs = issue with logic"
echo "• Present logs but still exits = browser blocking"

echo ""
echo "🎮 Browser Console Debug Commands:"
echo ""
echo "// Check current settings:"
echo "localStorage.getItem('animeflix_auto_fullscreen')"
echo "localStorage.getItem('animeflix_fullscreen_permission')"
echo ""
echo "// Manual reset:"
echo "localStorage.removeItem('animeflix_fullscreen_permission')"

echo "🌐 Ready to test: http://localhost:3050"
